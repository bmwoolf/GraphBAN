# GraphBAN
A deep learning model for predicting compound-protein interactions using a bilinear attention network with knowledge distillation and domain adaptation. It combines GCNs, pretrained LLMs (ChemBERTa & ESM), and a student-teacher architecture to generalize across unseen compounds and proteins.
